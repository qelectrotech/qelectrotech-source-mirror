* Title block editor :
Added new title block variables %projectpath, %projectfilename, %projecttitle, previous-folio-num and next-folio-num
"%saveddate, %savedtime, %savedfilename and %savedfilepath" they variables should be updated after file save or save as dialog is confirmed,
before file is saved.



* Improve for new qet_tb_generator plug-in : added the full path of the current project as
an argument when calling the plug-in from QET if a project is open.

* Fix : in some condition, dynamic text are not at the same position when open a project.
* On windows when user drag and drop an element from the common elements collection to the custom elements collection,
the element file stay in read only mode, and so user can't save the element

====== ChangeLog from 0.22 to 0.3a ======

===== Application =====

Elements collection: QElectroTech now provides 1465 elements within 233 categories (0.22 provided 153 elements within 51 categories). Most elements are related to electricity though some relate to chillers, solar, hydraulic and pneumatic engineering.
A new kind of collections appeared to store title block templates; as for elements, there is a distinction between common (system-wide) templates and custom (user-wide) templates.
Translations:
English, Spanish, French, Portuguese and Czech translations have been maintained.
Russian translations have been removed because they are not maintained anymore.
Polish, German, Italian, Arabic and Croatian translations have been added.
Following translation to Arabic, some work was done to improve Right-To-Left languages support.
Elements names are fully translated to English, French, Czech and Polish.
Main windows: added a “What's this?” action.
QElectroTech now handles *.titleblock files.

===== Diagram editor =====

It is now possible to move and rotate all texts on a diagram : element texts, conductor texts and independent texts.
When moving a text related to an electrical element, this element is highlighted.
Texts related to a conductor cannot be moved too far away from it.
It is now possible to create diagrams with more than 100 rows/columns.
Elements panel:
During a drag and drop operation, the hovered item is now expanded after a short time not moving the mouse.
Items are now expanded/collapsed by a double click.
Common, custom and embedded collections of title block templates are displayed within the elements panel.
Elements previews and names are now cached into a SQLite database stored in the user configuration directory, thus speeding up the elements panel (re)loading
The elements panel now displays the folio index before each diagram title.
UI consistency: renamed “Import element” to “Open an element file”, separated this action from those related to the current selection, and ensured elements-related actions are disabled when selecting a project/diagram/title block template.
Freshly integrated elements are now highlighted in the elements panel – this behaviour can be disabled though.
When clearing the search field, the panel state is restored to its previous state.
Title blocks are now rendered using templates:
For each diagram, users can choose the template to be used in the diagram properties.
They may also drag and drop it from the elements panel to the diagram.
Title block templates are always integrated within the parent project.
Fixed a bug in the print preview dialog.
Added a F2 shortcut for the widget “Edit the color of the given conductor”.
As elements, diagrams now have a “version” attribute for compatibility purposes.
Better handling of file opening for documents saved with newer versions of QElectroTech.
Diagram loading: removed an optimization that could lead to conductors not being loaded when several terminals share the same coordinates.
Users may now enter visualisation mode by pressing Ctrl and Shift.
Printing: when printing diagrams with no title block, use the space left by the title block.
Added a few status and “What's this?” tips.
Got rid of the green icon used for projects, changed a few other icons.

===== Element editor =====

Both static and dynamic texts can now be rotated
Added “dotted” line style
Added white color for texts
Newly added parts are placed above existing ones.

===== Title block template editor =====

A third kind of editor was implemented so users can create their own title block templates:

It allows users to customize the layout and content of cells that constitute the title block.
Cells can be merged and splitted.
Their width can be fixed, relative to the total width or relative to the remaining widths.
Their height is a simple fixed length.
They contain either a logo (be it in SVG or a usual bitmap format) or some text.
The text value is optionally preceded by a label.
As other texts within QElectroTech, labels and texts can be translated to other languages.
Texts and labels may contain variables (e.g. %company-name); these variables are replaced by real world values once the template is applied to a diagram.
Those real-world values can be set among the diagram properties.


====== Changelog 0.11 -> 0.2 ======
À partir de la version 0.2, QElectroTech est disponible en français, anglais, mais aussi :
  * en espagnol, grâce aux traductions de Youssef ;
  * en russe, grâce aux traductions de Yuriy ;
  * en portugais, grâce aux traductions de José.
L'application utilise désormais le thème d'icônes Oxygen, réalisé par Nuno Pinheiro pour le projet KDE.

===== Notion de fichier projet =====
Un fichier .qet peut désormais contenir zéro, un ou plusieurs schémas électriques. Les éléments composant ces schémas sont embarqués dans le fichier projet au moment où ils sont posés sur un schéma. Le panel d'éléments affiche donc désormais :
  * les projets ouverts, avec, sous chaque projet :
    * les schémas de ce projet,
    * la collection embarquée du projet (catégories et éléments utilisés dans les schémas)
  * la collection commune fournie par QET,
  * et la collection personnelle de l'utilisateur.

===== Éditeur de schémas =====
  * Il est désormais possible de déplacer et copier les catégories et éléments par simple glisser-déposer (drag'n drop) dans le panel d'éléments.
  * La collection embarquée est manipulable au même titre que la collection utilisateur. Les éléments inutilisés dans le projet apparaissent sur fond rouge et un dialogue permet de les purger rapidement.
  * Chaque projet embarque également (au niveau de ses propriétés) les paramétrages par défaut pour les nouveaux schémas, cartouches et conducteurs.
  * Il est possible de changer l'ordre des schémas dans le projet en déplaçant les onglets qui les représente. Dans le champ "Folio" des cartouches, on peut se référer à la position du schéma courant ou au nombre total de schémas dans le projet en écrivant respectivement %id et %total.
  * Lors du chargement d'un fichier .qet, si des éléments ne sont pas trouvés, ils sont remplacés par un élément "fantôme", ce qui évite de perdre certaines informations lors de l'enregistrement du fichier.
  * Le rendu avec un zoom réduit a été amélioré.
  * Enfin, le logiciel gère l'ouverture en lecture seule d'un fichier projet.

==== Impression et export ====

À partir de la version 0.2, QElectroTech :
  * propose d'utiliser une imprimante réelle ou bien de générer un document PDF ou PostScript, et ce sous Windows comme sous X11.
  * génère un aperçu avant l'impression d'un projet. Cet aperçu permet de choisir les options d'impression mais également les schémas à imprimer ou non.

À noter toutefois une limitation pour les impressions PDF/PS sous Windows : le dialogue de mise en page, permettant de spécifier le format du papier ainsi que ses marges, n'est pas disponible.

Le dialogue "Exporter" (pour générer un fichier image d'un schéma) a également été refait dans l'optique d'un export simultané de tous les schémas du projet.

===== Éditeur d'éléments =====

  * Lorsque l'on dessine une ligne dans l'éditeur d'éléments, il est possible de choisir un embout différent pour chaque extrémité, comme par exemple une flèche, un cercle, un carré ou, tout simplement, un bout de ligne normal.
  * La forme "Rectangle" a été ajoutée.
  * On peut enregistrer un élément en désignant un fichier (= comportement en 0.11) ou bien en choisissant un élément cible dans une liste reprenant l'arborescence du panel d'éléments.
  * Si l'on maintient la touche Shift lorsque l'on ajoute une partie (droite, cercle, texte, ...), l'outil en cours est conservé après le dessin. Sinon l'éditeur repasse sur l'outil de sélection.
  * La grille a été améliorée : sa densité varie en fonction du zoom ; les points correspondant à ceux de la grille de l'éditeur de schémas sont mis en valeur.
  * L'accrochage à la grille (aka "snap to grid", également connu sous le nom de grille magnétique ou encore grille aimantée) a été ajouté. Le dessin s'y accroche désormais avec une précision de 1px. On peut travailler en coordonnées libres en maintenant la touche Ctrl enfoncée durant le dessin.
  * Le copier-coller a été implémenté : il est possible de coller :
     * avec le bouton du milieu de la souris
     * en choisissant une "zone de collage" sur l'élément (Ctrl+Shift+V)
     * directement (Ctrl+V) : les parties collées sont placées à côté des parties copiées ; si on recolle les parties, elles sont collées encore un cran à côté, et ce de manière incrémentale.
  * Des contrôles sont désormais effectués à l'enregistrement : présence de bornes, respect du cadre, etc.
  * Uniformisation des menus par rapport à l'éditeur de schémas

====== Changelog 0.1 -> 0.11 ======

===== Fonctionnalités et interface =====

  * L'application est désormais capable d'ouvrir un fichier élément passe en paramètre
  * L'application se lance désormais une seule fois par utilisateur
  * Lors de l'ouverture d'un fichier en dehors de l'application alors que QET est déjà démarré celui-ci essaye de s'afficher ou d'attirer l'attention de l'utilisateur.
  * L'application vérifie que ce fichier n'est pas déjà ouvert dans tous les éditeurs de schémas / éléments.
  * Ajout de fichiers permettant d'automatiser les associations de fichiers sous Windows (.bat et .reg) et X11 (.desktop et .xml)
  * Ajout de menus "Récemment ouverts" pour accéder aux fichiers récents dans les éditeurs de schémas et éléments.
  * Ajout d'un splash screen
  * La hauteur du schéma est désormais gérée via un système de lignes, dont le nombre et la hauteur sont ajustables.
  * Il est également possible d'afficher ou non les en-têtes des lignes et/ou des colonnes.
  * Ajout d'une option --lang-dir
  * Ajout d'une description dans le dialogue des options d'impression
  * Ajout de pages de manuel Unix (`man') en anglais et en français

===== Corrections de bugs =====

  * Bug #12 : QET provoquait une erreur de segmentation dès son démarrage dans un environnement sans systray
  * Bug #14 : il manquait un / dans le chemin proposé lors de l'impression vers un PDF
  * Bug #15 : Mauvais positionnement des champs de texte sur le schéma
  * Bug #16 : Mauvaise gestion des modifications du texte d'un conducteur
  * La classe DiagramView écrivait sur la sortie d'erreur sans fin de ligne
  * L'option --config-dir était mal prise en compte
  * Après fermeture d'un schema, le menu Fenêtres n'était pas correctement mis à jour
  * Les textes des éléments, des conducteurs, du cartouche ainsi que les textes indépendants utilisent désormais tous la même police.
  * Remise à niveau de l'impression suite au passage à Qt 4.4

===== Code et détails techniques =====

  * Corrections pour que QET compile avec gcc-4.3
  * Les classes Conductor et Element héritent désormais de QObject (dépendance sur Qt 4.4)
  * Affinage du constructeur de la classe QETApp
  * Moins d'avertissements à la compilation (testé avec gcc 4.3)
  * Moins d'inclusions non pertinentes
  * Nettoyage du trunk : déplacement des sources dans un sous-répertoire
