	This class manages the interactive movement of different items (elements,

	A movement work in 3 steps:
	1: beginMovement    -> init a new movement
	2: continueMovement -> continue the current movement
	3: endMovement      -> finish the current movement

	A movement in progress must finish before starting a new movement. We can
	know if element mover is ready for a new movement by calling isReady().
