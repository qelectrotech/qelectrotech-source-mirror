/**
	@brief The DiagramEventInterface class
	isRunning() return true if action is running (do something). By default return false.
 *
	##USE DiagramEventInterface##
	This class is the basic interface for manage event on a diagram.
	To create a behavior for event diagram, we need to herite this class.
	This interface work like this :
	You need to create an interface and call diagram::setEventInterface(pointer_of_your_interface).
	When a diagram get an event (mouse or key) if they have an event interface,
	they send the event (with the status accepted to false) to the interface (for example mousePressEvent).
	If the interface do something with this event, you need to set to true the accepted status of the event, then diagram do nothing.
	When the interface job is done, we need to emit the signal finish(), the diagram use this signal to delete the interface.
	Be carreful with the destructor, diagram can at any time (even if interface is still running) delete the interface,
	the bool m_abort is here for that at destruction time.
