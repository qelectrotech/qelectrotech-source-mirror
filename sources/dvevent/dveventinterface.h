	@brief The DVEventInterface class
	This class is the main interface for manage event of a Diagram View.
	This does nothing, to create new event behavior,
	we must create new class from this.
	Each method returns a bool:
	True if the method does something, else return false.
	Each method of DVEventInterface returns false;
	isRunning() returns true if action is started but not finished.
	By default: return false.
	isFinish() returns true when the action is finished, or not started.
	By default: return true.
