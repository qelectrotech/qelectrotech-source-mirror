/**
	@brief The QWidgetAnimation class
	This class animate the show and hide function of a QWidget.

	The role of behavior is to calcul as best the animation process
	when widget is show.
	Because this class doesn't change the current and final size
	of the widget but its maximum size during the animation process,
	we need to know in advance the final size of the widget.
	Behavior minimumSizeHint : the final size of the widget
	will be its minimum size hint.
	Behavior availableSpace : the final size of widget will be
	the available size of its parent.
	Since parent can have other widgets you can add a QVector of widget
	to subtract from the final size.
	Because we suppose the animated widget will take the maximum
	available space, we subtract the minimum size hint of widgets in QVector.
	Behavior lastSize :
	The widget will have the same size as the last time it was displayed.
